algorithm: build huffman tree
input: nodes containing characters with their frequency
output: root of huffman tree

step1: insert all the nodes containing each character with their frequency in ascending priority queue
step2: while priority queue has more than 1 node:
step3: dequeue two nodes c1 and c2 from the priority queue
step3: create new node n
step4: n->key = sum of c1->key and c2->key
step5: n->left = c1, n->right=c2
step6: pq.enqueue(n)
step7: end while
step8: dequeue result from priority queue
step9: return result node


algorithm: generateHuffmanCode(root,code)

step1: if root is leaf node:
        enqueue code and character into pq 
        return
step2: generateHuffmanCode(root->left,code+'0')
step3: generateHuffmanCode(root->right,code+'1');
step4: end
